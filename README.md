Clone of Snake using Python

Written in Python 3.5.1 using the curses module for terminal display and control.

The code supports two different game options, the first will end the game when a wall is hit by the head of the snake,
the second game mode allows the snake to pass through the walls to the other side and the game will only end if the
snake runs into its tail.

By default, the game allows the snake to pass through the walls, to enable the other game mode where hitting a wall
results in a game over, simply comment out line 43 in the snake_game.py file and un-comment line 42 in that same file.
