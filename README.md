# Snake
### Clone of the classic game snake

Written in Python 3.5.1 using the curses module for terminal display and control.

The game supports two different gameplay options, the first will end the game when a wall is hit by the head of the snake and
the second allows the snake to pass through the walls to the other side. The game will only end if the
snake runs into its body, in option 2.

To choose solid walls select option 1 on the selection screen, selecting option 2 will allow the snake to pass through
the walls to the other side.

Written and tested on Mac OS El Capitan
